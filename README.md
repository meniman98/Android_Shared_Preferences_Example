# Android_Shared_Preferences_Example
Simple shared preferences app 

This app can tell if you are a first time user. An alert dialog will pop up if you are.
However, once the app is closed, it knows you have visited previously, so it won't show the alert dialog.
Shared preferences are used in a variety of apps to save the user's preferences, like enabling dark mode

To see the dialog again, uninstall the app, then install again. You'll see the alert dialog again
